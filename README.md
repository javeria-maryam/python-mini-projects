Python Mini Projects 🐍

This repository contains beginner-friendly mini projects created while learning Python fundamentals.
The goal of these projects is to practice concepts like variables, functions, OOP, file handling, exceptions, and NumPy.

These are learning projects, not portfolio-level ones — they help strengthen Python basics before moving on to applied AI & Data Science projects.

📂 Projects Included

Student Grade Calculator – Calculate students grades based on their marks.

Word Counter – Count frequency of words in a text file.

Guessing Game – A simple number guessing game.

Shopping Cart – Add/remove items, calculate totals with error handling.

(More coming as we progress…)

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/python-mini-projects.git


Navigate into the project folder and run any script:

cd student_grade_calculator
python grade_calculator.py

📌 Notes

These projects are part of my Python learning roadmap.

Later, I will build portfolio projects (like Data Cleaning, Analysis, AI mini apps) in a separate repository
