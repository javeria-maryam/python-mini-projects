# 🎯 Guessing Game

## 📌 Project Description
This is a simple Python guessing game.  
The computer randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**, and the player has to guess it.  
After each guess, the program gives feedback:  

- **Too high** if the guess is greater than the number  
- **Too low** if the guess is smaller than the number  
- **Correct!** when guessed right  

The game also tracks the number of attempts.
